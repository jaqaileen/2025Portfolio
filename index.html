              The Shape of Water is an analysis essay turned zine that explores the duality of women in Greek mythology
              through the lens of water: a force that both nurtures life and brings destruction.
              <br><br>
              This project reimagines classical myths to examine how femininity is often tied to nature’s most fluid and
              unpredictable element.

              Players weave their ideas together by physically interlocking the cards through slits, building layered

              revealing how creativity, collaboration, and meaning can interlace into something greater than the sum of
              its parts.

              creating a multifaceted narrative that speaks to the significance of street food in NYC. This approach

            <p>Based in Jakarta, BUMI Museum is a Natural History and Geology museum dedicated to bridging the worlds of
              science, art, and cultural heritage. It offers visitors an immersive understanding of Indonesia’s rich
              geological history while nurturing a sense of wonder and responsibility toward preserving the earth’s
              treasures.
              <br>
              <br>
              I created the brand identity guide book for BUMI Museum, developing a visual and narrative system that
              reflects its mission to connect people with the natural beauty and history of our planet.

              Building on the museum’s visual language, I designed and developed a website that showcases BUMI’s
